# What is this?

Coracle is a web client for the Nostr protocol focused on pushing the boundaries of what's unique about nostr, including relay selection and management, web-of-trust based moderation and content recommendations, and privacy protection. Check it out at [coracle.social](https://coracle.social).

# Customization

Coracle is intended to be fully white-labeled by groups of various kinds. The following environment variables can be set in `.env.local` to customize Coracle's appearance and behavior:

- `VITE_DARK_THEME` and `VITE_LIGHT_THEME` are comma-separate lists of key/value pairs defining theme colors.
- `VITE_DVM_RELAYS` is a comma-separated list of relays to use when making requests against DVMs.
- `VITE_SEARCH_RELAYS` is a comma-separated list of relays to use when using NIP 50 search.
- `VITE_DEFAULT_RELAYS` is a comma-separated list of relays to use as defaults/fallbacks.
- `VITE_DEFAULT_FOLLOWS` is a comma-separated list of hex pubkeys to fetch content from when the user isn't following anyone.
- `VITE_ONBOARDING_LISTS` is a comma-separated list of `kind:30003` person lists to populate onboarding with.
- `VITE_NIP96_URLS` is a comma-separated list of default upload providers.
- `VITE_IMGPROXY_URL` is an [imgproxy](https://imgproxy.net) instance url for protecting user privacy and reducing bandwidth use.
- `VITE_DUFFLEPUD_URL` is a [Dufflepud](https://github.com/coracle-social/dufflepud) instance url, which helps Coracle with things like link previews and image uploads.
- `VITE_PLATFORM_ZAP_SPLIT` is a decimal between 0 and 1 defining the default zap split percent.
- `VITE_PLATFORM_PUBKEY` is the pubkey of the platform owner. This gets zapped when using the platform zap split.
- `VITE_PLATFORM_RELAYS` is an optional comma-separated list of relay urls to use for feeds. If provided, most UI components related to relay selection will be hidden from the user.
- `VITE_ENABLE_ZAPS` can be set to `false` to disable zaps.
- `VITE_APP_NAME` is the app's name.
- `VITE_APP_URL` is the app's url. Used to generate open graph meta tags.

- `VITE_APP_DESCRIPTION` is the app's description.
- `VITE_CLIENT_NAME` is the client's name. Only change this if you have forked Coracle.
- `VITE_CLIENT_ID` is the client's NIP 89 handler id. Only change this if you have forked Coracle.
- `VITE_GLITCHTIP_API_KEY` is your glitchtip DSN.
- `GLITCHTIP_API_KEY` is your glitchtip auth token for uploading source maps.
- `VITE_BUILD_HASH` can be set during build to indicate the software version on the about page.
- `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` can be set to `info`, `warn`, or `error`. This controls how much shows up in the console.
