# What is this?

Coracle is a web client for the Nostr protocol focused on pushing the boundaries of what's unique about nostr, including relay selection and management, web-of-trust based moderation and content recommendations, and privacy protection. Check it out at [coracle.social](https://coracle.social).

[Dufflepud](https://github.com/coracle-social/dufflepud) is a companion server which you can self-host. It helps Coracle with things like link previews and image uploads.

If you like Coracle and want to support its development, you can donate sats via [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/coracle).
